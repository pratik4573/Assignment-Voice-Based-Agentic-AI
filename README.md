# 🎙️ Voice-Based Agentic AI

## 📌 Assignment Overview
This project demonstrates the **architecture, technology stack, and implementation of a Voice-Based Agentic AI system**.  
A voice-based agentic AI is an intelligent system capable of understanding spoken input, reasoning autonomously, executing actions using tools or APIs, and responding back through synthesized speech.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Study and present the **architecture of a Voice-Based Agentic AI**
- Identify the **technology stack** required to build such a system
- Implement a **sample chatbot program** to demonstrate agentic behavior
- Understand how AI agents reason, plan, and act

---

## 🧠 What is Agentic AI?
Agentic AI refers to AI systems that can:
- Understand user intent
- Perform multi-step reasoning
- Decide which actions or tools to use
- Act autonomously to complete tasks

When combined with **voice interfaces**, the system becomes more interactive and human-like.
